# Java Algorithms

A collection of common algorithms implemented in Java.

## Algorithms Included

- **Sliding Window** - Efficient technique for problems involving subarrays or substrings
- **Two Pointers** - Method for array/list traversal and comparison problems
- Additional algorithms (to be documented)

## Usage

Each algorithm is implemented as a standalone Java class with examples and test cases.
